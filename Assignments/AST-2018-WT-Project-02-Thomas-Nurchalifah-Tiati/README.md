Team members:
1. Raina Thomas
2. Oumaima Tiati
3. Desiana Dien Nurchalifah

Initial Requirements - Exended:
1. Code language			: Java
2. Coding standard			: Eclipse
3. Testing framework		: JUnit
4. Data structure			: Array of objects
5. Input and output format	: Array of objects

* Question on whether code follows S.O.L.I.D principle on "Open for update but closed for changes"
Code follows S.O.L.I.D principle as it allocates inputs dynamically. Code has fixed classed that contains name, number and percentage of object. Therefore the changes for the object itself is closed but if the user wants to add more features, it is open.

* Test for S.O.L.I.D principle is given on testcase 7 as it combines inputs from sensors.

* Code uses Design Pattern
Code has followed S.O.L.I.D principle. Code itself has followed Factory Design pattern for Java.
