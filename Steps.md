* This takes you to the bottom of the webpage where you have to choose a payment plan. Choose the free plan.
* Login to your github account.
* Select the repository that you want to link to Travis.
* Create a .travis.yml file.
* Add the following content in the file if using the language Java and Ant Build.

```
language: java
jdk:
  - oraclejdk8

script: ant build
```
* Commit and push this file to your github repo.
* This will cause a Travis CI build.
* Everytime a new code is pushed to the repo with an antbuild file 'build.xml', the Travis CI build is triggered and it checks the code build.

## Steps for adding the badges to README.md

* To add the badge from Travis, paste the following code in the README file.

```
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/{ORG-or-USERNAME}/{REPO-NAME}.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/{ORG-or-USERNAME}/{REPO-NAME})
```

* Replace the {ORG-or-USERNAME} with the username of the github.
* Replace the {REPO-NAME} with the name of the github repository used for Travis.
* In the field 'branch=master' choose the branch to be built.

Given below is the code that is being used for our repository.
